The residential segment encompasses coatings and paints used in private homes, including interior walls, exteriors, and specialty finishes. This sector is driven by trends in home improvement, aesthetic preferences, and DIY projects. Innovations in paint technology, such as eco-friendly and low-VOC formulations, are increasingly popular among homeowners looking to enhance both the visual appeal and sustainability of their living spaces. Additionally, the rise in property renovation and remodeling projects contributes to the growth of this segment, as consumers seek high-quality products that provide durability and style.</p><p>In contrast, the commercial segment covers coatings and paints used in non-residential spaces such as offices, retail environments, industrial facilities, and public buildings. This category is influenced by the need for durability, resistance to wear and tear, and compliance with regulatory standards. Commercial applications often require specialized coatings that meet specific performance criteria, such as fire resistance or antimicrobial properties. The expansion of urban infrastructure, commercial real estate developments, and the increasing emphasis on creating aesthetically pleasing yet functional workspaces drive demand in this sector.
